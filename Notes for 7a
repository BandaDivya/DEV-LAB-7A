Tableau automatically aggregates measures placed on Rows/Columns (SUM, AVG, etc.).
Use aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() in calculated fields when combining measures.
For row-by-row calculations (unaggregated), use fields without aggregation (e.g., [Price] - [Cost]) only if the field is at row context; otherwise wrap with aggregation or use LODs.
